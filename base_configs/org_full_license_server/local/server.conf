# In distributed environments, it's common to have a lone search head acting
# as the license manager as well. In this configuration, providing the URI
# of the license manager is easiest within the indexer_base configuration.
# In the event that there are multiple search heads, you could instead use
# the org_all_license app, shipped to the non-license SH, as well as all of
# the indexers. In either event, the settings are the same.

# DEPRECATED since 9.0 use manager_uri instead
# Example: master_uri = https://license.master.example.com:8089
#master_uri = https://fqdn.of.license.master:mgmt_port

# Example: manager_uri = https://license.manager.example.com:8089
manager_uri = https://fqdn.of.license.manager:mgmt_port
